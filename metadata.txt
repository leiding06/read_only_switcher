about=Read-Only Switcher lets you quickly toggle the read-only status of multiple selected layers directly from the Layers panel; no need to open Project Properties. This makes it faster to manage and protect local or shared layers in a project, especially in collaborative environments where data safety is important. You can easily lock layers to prevent accidental edits, and unlock them when needed, all in one click.
