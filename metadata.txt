about=Read-Only Switcher enables you to quickly toggle the read-only flag for one or more selected vector layers directly from the Layers panel, eliminating the need to open the Project Properties dialog. When multiple layers with mixed read-only statuses are selected, the plugin sets all layers to read-only by default to ensure data safety. Raster layers and other non-vector layers are automatically excluded from the toggling process, with clear notifications to the user. This tool streamlines layer management, protects your data from accidental edits, and is especially useful in collaborative environments where different users may need different editing permissions on the same project.
